# The Hitchhiker Prophecy App

The Heroes and Heroines of the Marvel world should be viewed in two modes. Horizontal with Card Like Views and Vertically in a List View.

In The horizontal card view, cards should be peeking from the side to alert the user that there are other cards still that he can scroll through.
Also this scene should have a button that switches the card like design to a list of all the superheroes.

If a superhero cell is tapped we should then navigate to a details scene that showcases the superhero's description.
